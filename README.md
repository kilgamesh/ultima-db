### About

I started Ultima my last project in 2022 because I one of my favorite aspects of video games is the iconic things that various characters say. So, I wanted to find an API to contribute to with some of my favorite quotes, and as far as I could tell, there weren't any. Hence, Ultima.rest was created.  

### Support
