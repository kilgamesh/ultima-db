<h2 align='center'>Note to Potential Contributors</h2>

<p align='center'>
	I am a sucker for a good PR (pull requests). But, if you're thinking of working on a large PR, I recommend opening up an issue first to talk about it!

## Adding Quotes

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the __main__ repository.
2. Checkout to the __migrate branch__
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -B add-quotes-USERNAME` e.g. `git checkout -B add-quotes-0hundred0`
5. Delete the old quotes found in the [data/quotes.json](data/quotes.json)
6. Add your quotes to the __quotes.json__ following the schema found in the [template](data/template.json). __Only changes to the quotes.json will be added.__
7. Save your work.
8. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr] in the __migrate branch__
9. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed for approval by a moderator.  

### Adding New Quotes (Simplified)

- Copy the data [template](./data/template.json) to paste into the [quotes.json](./data/quotes.json) making as many copies as needed.
- Once you've added your quotes and before you submit a push request make sure the template is not altered.
- After your additions are reviewed a member of the team will add your profile to the [Ultima.rest](https://ultima.rest) website. 
- The quote schema is as follows:

```json
quote: 'string' // The quote. We suggest no more than two sentences.
character: 'string', // Character name as it appears in game
title: 'string', // Game title without special symbols e.g. Crisis Final Fantasy VII
esrb: 'string', // E, E10, T, M, A, or RP
release: 'number'  // Year of Release
```  

### Disclaimer

As much as I appreciate all the help, please try to add at least 10 quotes before submitting a pull request. And those who submit 20 or more will be added to the "contributors" section on the Ultima website.  

## Workspace Layout

- `data` is where the quotes.json which is used to send quotes to the database is stored. Also houses the quotes template.json.
- `images` contains the images/gifs used for the markdown files.
- `lib` is where you can find the prisma client is initialized and the database management functions.
- `prisma` is where the prisma schema and migration files are located. It is also where the .env file for the database can be found
- `prisma/.env.example` includes an __example__ of what the supabase urls look like if the app was created
- `src` is where the database server is connected and the data functions are ran to manage
- `tsconfig.json` includes the tailwind custom styles and content pointers

### The workspace layout is purely for informational purposes, please do not edit the files without moderator approval
